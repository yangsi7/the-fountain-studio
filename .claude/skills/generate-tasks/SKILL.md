# Task Generation

**Purpose**: Transform implementation plans into executable, user-story-organized task breakdowns following Article VII (User-Story-Centric Organization).

**Constitutional Authority**: Article VII (User-Story-Centric Organization), Article III (Test-First Imperative), Article VIII (Parallelization Markers)

---

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Output | Article |
|-------|---------------|--------|---------|
| **1. Load Context** | Validate prerequisites, load spec.md, plan.md, supporting docs | Context loaded | Article IV |
| **2-3. Task Generation** | Organize by user story, generate tests/impl/verification | Task phases | Article VII, III |
| **4. Parallelization** | Mark [P] for tasks that can run simultaneously | [P] markers added | Article VIII |
| **5. Quality Gate** | Automatically invoke /audit for validation | Audit report | Article V |
| **6. Generate tasks.md** | Write using template, report completion | tasks.md | All |

---

## Phase 1: Load Context

### Step 1.1: Validate Prerequisites

PreToolUse hook blocks tasks.md without plan.md, but verify:

```bash
FEATURE=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "${SPECIFY_FEATURE:-}")

if [[ ! -f "specs/$FEATURE/spec.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Missing specification (Article IV violation)"
    exit 1
fi

if [[ ! -f "specs/$FEATURE/plan.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Missing implementation plan (Article IV violation)"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 1.2: Load Specification (User Stories)

```bash
Read specs/$FEATURE/spec.md
```

**Extract**:
- User stories with priorities (P1, P2, P3...)
- Independent test criteria per story
- Functional requirements

### Step 1.3: Load Implementation Plan (Tech Details)

```bash
Read specs/$FEATURE/plan.md
```

**Extract**:
- Tech stack and frameworks
- Component breakdown
- Acceptance criteria (≥2 per story)
- File structure
- Integration points

### Step 1.4: Load Supporting Documents (If Available)

```bash
Read specs/$FEATURE/data-model.md  # Entity designs
Read specs/$FEATURE/contracts/*.md  # API specifications
Read specs/$FEATURE/quickstart.md  # Test scenarios
```

## Phase 2-3: Task Generation Workflow

**See:** @.claude/skills/generate-tasks/workflows/task-generation.md

**Summary**:

**Phase 2: Organize by User Story** (Article VII mandate)
- Required phase structure: Setup → Foundational → User Story Phases → Polish
- One phase per user story (P1, P2, P3...)
- Within each story: Tests → Implementation → Verification

**Phase 3: Generate Tasks**
- Setup tasks: Project initialization, dependencies
- Foundational tasks: Blocking prerequisites for ALL stories
- User Story tasks: Test-first approach (Article III)
  - Tests (≥2 per story)
  - Implementation (models, services, endpoints, UI)
  - Verification (run tests, validate independently)
- Polish tasks: Documentation, cleanup

**Task Format**:
- Task ID: T### (sequential numbering)
- Story Label: [US#] for traceability
- Parallel Marker: [P] for simultaneous execution

---

## Phase 4: Parallelization Marking

**See:** @.claude/skills/generate-tasks/workflows/parallelization.md

**Summary**:

Mark tasks with `[P]` if they meet ALL criteria:
1. **Different files** - No file conflicts with other parallel tasks
2. **No dependencies** - Doesn't depend on incomplete tasks
3. **Independent** - Can run without coordination

**Common Patterns**:
- Test writing (different test files) → Parallel
- Setup tasks (independent config) → Parallel
- Documentation updates (different docs) → Parallel
- Model dependencies (B uses A) → Sequential

**Document** parallel opportunities per phase in summary.

---

## Phase 5: Quality Gate Enforcement

**See:** @.claude/skills/generate-tasks/workflows/quality-gates.md

**Summary**:

After tasks.md created, **automatically invoke /audit command** (Article V requirement).

**DO NOT ask user to run /audit manually** - this is automatic enforcement.

**Audit Validates**:
1. Article IV compliance (spec → plan → tasks sequence)
2. Article VII compliance (user-story-centric organization)
3. Article III compliance (≥2 ACs per story, tests first)
4. Constitution violations (CRITICAL priority)
5. Requirement coverage (100% expected)
6. Ambiguities and underspecification

**On CRITICAL failures**: Implementation BLOCKED, user must fix issues and re-run /tasks
**On successful audit**: Ready for `/implement plan.md`

---

## Phase 6: Generate tasks.md

### Step 6.1: Write Using Template

Use `@.claude/templates/tasks.md` structure:

```yaml
---
feature: <number>-<name>
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
plan: specs/<number>-<name>/plan.md
status: Ready for Implementation
total_tasks: <count>
---
```

**Include**:
1. **Summary**: Total tasks, story breakdown
2. **Dependencies**: Graph showing story order
3. **Parallel Opportunities**: Count of [P] tasks per phase
4. **All Phases**: Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish
5. **Verification Checklist**: How to mark each task complete

**Save**: `specs/$FEATURE/tasks.md`

### Step 6.2: Report Completion

**Output**:
```
✓ Task breakdown created: specs/<number>-<name>/tasks.md

Task Summary:
- Total tasks: 45
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 3 tasks
- Phase 3 (US P1): 10 tasks (2 tests, 5 impl, 3 verify)
- Phase 4 (US P2): 12 tasks (3 tests, 6 impl, 3 verify)
- Phase 5 (US P3): 8 tasks (2 tests, 4 impl, 2 verify)
- Phase 6 (Polish): 8 tasks

Parallel Opportunities:
- Setup: 3 of 4 tasks can run in parallel
- User Story P1: 2 test tasks can run in parallel
- User Story P2: 3 test tasks can run in parallel

Acceptance Criteria Coverage:
- Total ACs: 8
- Tests mapped: 8 (100% coverage)
- Each AC has ≥1 test task

Story Independence:
- ✓ Each story has independent test criteria
- ✓ Stories can be implemented in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- ✓ Each story is demonstrable standalone

Constitutional Compliance:
- ✓ Article III: Tests before implementation (TDD)
- ✓ Article VII: Tasks organized by user story (not layer)
- ✓ Article VIII: Parallel tasks marked [P]

**Automatic Quality Gate**:
Running /audit command now for validation...

[Audit results will appear here]

If audit passes: Next Step: Run /implement plan.md
If audit fails: Fix CRITICAL issues first, then re-run /tasks
```

## Anti-Patterns & Best Practices

**See:** @.claude/skills/generate-tasks/references/anti-patterns.md

**Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Layer-based organization ("All models", "All services")
- ❌ Tasks without [US#] story labels
- ❌ Skipping test tasks (Article III violation)
- ❌ Mixing multiple stories in one phase
- ❌ Creating <2 tests per story
- ❌ Forgetting [P] parallelization markers

**Best Practices**:
- ✓ Organize by user story (one phase per story)
- ✓ Label all tasks with [US#]
- ✓ Tests before implementation (TDD)
- ✓ Independent test criteria per story
- ✓ Mark parallel tasks with [P]
- ✓ Verify 100% AC coverage

## Example Task Breakdown

**See:** @.claude/skills/generate-tasks/examples/task-examples.md

**Complete Example**: User Authentication feature with 2 user stories (Registration, Login)

**Demonstrates**:
- Setup → Foundational → User Story Phases → Polish structure
- Test-first approach (Article III)
- Story-centric organization (Article VII)
- [P] parallelization markers (Article VIII)
- Independent test criteria per story
- 100% AC coverage with test task mapping

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill:
- ✅ spec.md exists (Article IV: specification-first)
- ✅ plan.md exists (Article IV: plan before tasks)
- ✅ PreToolUse hook validates both files exist (automatic enforcement)
- ✅ User stories with priorities defined in spec.md
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined in plan.md (≥2 per story)
- ⚠️ Optional: data-model.md exists (for entity-based tasks)
- ⚠️ Optional: contracts/ exist (for API task breakdown)

## Dependencies

**Depends On**:
- **specify-feature skill** - Provides spec.md with user stories
- **create-implementation-plan skill** - MUST run before this skill (Article IV)
- **clarify-specification skill** - Should have resolved ambiguities before planning

**Integrates With**:
- **implement-and-verify skill** - Uses tasks.md output as implementation roadmap
- **/audit command** - Automatically invoked after task generation
- **/implement command** - Requires tasks.md to exist before execution

**Tool Dependencies**:
- Read tool (to load spec.md, plan.md, supporting docs)
- Write tool (to create tasks.md)

## Next Steps

After task generation completes, **automatic workflow progression**:

**Automatic Chain** (no manual intervention):
```
generate-tasks (creates tasks.md)
    ↓ (auto-invokes /audit)
/audit (validates cross-artifact consistency)
    ↓ (if PASS)
Ready for /implement
```

**User Action Required**:
- **If audit PASS**: Run `/implement plan.md` to begin implementation
- **If audit FAIL**: Fix CRITICAL issues in spec.md, plan.md, or tasks.md, then re-run generate-tasks

**Outputs Created**:
- `specs/$FEATURE/tasks.md` - User-story-organized task breakdown
- `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-audit-$FEATURE.md` - Quality gate validation report (automatic)

**Commands**:
- **/implement plan.md** - Begin implementation (after audit passes)
- **/audit $FEATURE** - Re-run audit if changes made to artifacts
- **/verify plan.md --story P1** - Verify individual story completion (during implementation)

## Agent Integration

This skill operates within the planner agent's workflow but does not directly invoke other agents.

### Relationship to Implementation Planner

**Context**: This skill is typically invoked BY the `create-implementation-plan` skill as part of automatic workflow progression.

**Execution**:
- Usually runs in main conversation context (not isolated agent)
- Can run within implementation-planner agent if plan creation and task generation combined
- Inherits context from previous workflow steps (spec.md, plan.md)

### Audit Agent (Indirect)

**When**: Automatically after tasks.md is created

**Agent**: None directly - `/audit` command may use specialized validation logic

**Delegation Method**: This skill automatically invokes `/audit` command via SlashCommand tool

```
generate-tasks skill (creates tasks.md)
    ↓ invokes
/audit command (SlashCommand tool)
    ↓ expands to
Validation workflow (constitution checks, consistency analysis)
    ↓ produces
audit report (PASS/FAIL with findings)
```

### Implementation Executor (Next Stage)

**When**: After audit passes, user runs `/implement`

**Agent**: executor-implement-verify

**Handover**: This skill prepares tasks.md which the executor agent consumes

**What Executor Receives** (from tasks.md):
- User stories organized by priority (P1, P2, P3...)
- Tasks per story with acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and blocking relationships
- Test strategy and verification approach

### Task Tool Usage

This skill does NOT directly use the Task tool. It:
1. Runs in main context or within planner agent
2. Invokes `/audit` via SlashCommand tool (automatic)
3. Prepares output for executor agent (consumed later)

**Design Rationale**:
- Task generation is deterministic (doesn't need agent isolation)
- Constitutional checks integrated into generation process
- Workflow orchestration via slash commands (cleaner than nested Task calls)

## Failure Modes

### Common Failures & Solutions

**1. plan.md does not exist (Article IV violation)**
- **Symptom**: PreToolUse hook blocks with "Cannot create tasks without implementation plan"
- **Solution**: Run create-implementation-plan skill or /plan command first
- **Prevention**: Follow SDD workflow order: /feature → /plan → /tasks → /implement

**2. User stories missing priorities (P1, P2, P3)**
- **Symptom**: Cannot organize tasks by story priority
- **Solution**: Update spec.md to add priority labels to all user stories
- **Guidance**: P1 = must-have MVP, P2 = important enhancements, P3 = nice-to-have

**3. Acceptance criteria insufficient (< 2 per story)**
- **Symptom**: Article III violation detected during task generation
- **Solution**: Update plan.md to add ≥2 acceptance criteria per user story
- **Requirement**: Each AC must be testable and independently verifiable

**4. Task organization by layer instead of story**
- **Symptom**: Article VII violation - tasks grouped by "All Models", "All Services", etc.
- **Solution**: Reorganize tasks by user story: Phase per story, tasks for that story only
- **Prevention**: Review @constitution.md Article VII before generating tasks

**5. Tests missing or after implementation tasks**
- **Symptom**: Article III violation - no test tasks OR test tasks after implementation
- **Solution**: Add test tasks for each AC, place BEFORE implementation tasks
- **Pattern**: Tests → Implementation → Verification (always this order)

**6. Parallel markers missing or incorrect**
- **Symptom**: Article VIII violation - no [P] markers OR [P] on dependent tasks
- **Solution**: Add [P] only to tasks with different files and no dependencies
- **Check**: Can T008 and T009 run simultaneously? Different files + no dependencies = [P]

**7. Story independence not verified**
- **Symptom**: User stories depend on each other, cannot be demoed standalone
- **Solution**: Add "Independent Test" criteria to each story phase
- **Requirement**: Each story must work without other stories implemented

**8. Audit invocation skipped**
- **Symptom**: tasks.md created but audit not run automatically
- **Solution**: Skill should invoke /audit command automatically (not ask user to run it)
- **Enforcement**: Article V (Template-Driven Quality) requires automatic quality gates

**9. Task IDs not sequential or story labels missing**
- **Symptom**: Tasks numbered T001, T010, T100 (gaps) OR no [US#] labels
- **Solution**: Use sequential T001, T002, T003... and add [US#] to all story-specific tasks
- **Example**: T008 [P] [US1] Write test for AC-P1-001

**10. Missing verification tasks per story**
- **Symptom**: No tasks to verify story completion, unclear when story is done
- **Solution**: Add verification phase to each story with tasks to run tests and validate
- **Pattern**: "Run all US# tests (must pass 100%)", "Test story independently"
